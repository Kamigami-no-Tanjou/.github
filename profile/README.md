# Kamigami no Tanjou
A project about a fantasy world.

I (RedNeath) started this project, taking a lot of inspiration from the japanese anime Black Clover during march 2020, with the ambition of making it into another anime series itself. Today, it has only kept growing more and more, and has become the most important I've ever been involved in. Things have evolved quite a lot, and I can only be proud of what they've become, as I am currently writing the first book that will narrate the story of it.

The journey will begin with Mi Vulca as the main character, and you'll be able to find here all the pieces of software I developped to help myself on the writing, or just related to it in a certain manner.
